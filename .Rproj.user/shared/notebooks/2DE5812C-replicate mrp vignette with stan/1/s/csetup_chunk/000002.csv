- Do not expect the default priors to remain the same in future rstanarm versions.
Thus, R scripts should specify priors explicitly, even if they are just the defaults.
- For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
- bayesplot theme set to bayesplot::theme_default()
   * Does _not_ affect other ggplot2 plots
   * See ?bayesplot_theme_set for details on theme setting

rstan (Version 2.19.3, GitRev: 2e1f913d3ca3)
For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()).
To avoid recompilation of unchanged Stan programs, we recommend calling
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)
For improved execution time, we recommend calling
Sys.setenv(LOCAL_CPPFLAGS = '-march=corei7 -mtune=corei7')
although this causes Stan to throw an error on a few processors.
